HBNB - The Console
This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.
The goal of the project is to design a comprehensive database for the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
2. A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
3. A comprehensive database to manage  the backend functionalities
